# Logo Assets

## Logo File
Place your LEI Indias logo image file here with the filename: `logo.png`

The logo should be:
- PNG format (or update the file extension in components if using a different format)
- Recommended size: At least 300x80px for optimal quality
- Transparent background preferred for header usage

## Supported Formats
The components are configured to use `/images/logo.png`. If your logo is in a different format (SVG, JPG, etc.), update the `src` attribute in the following files:
- `frontend/components/shared/Header.tsx`
- `frontend/components/shared/Footer.tsx`
- `frontend/app/admin/layout.tsx`
- `frontend/app/admin/login/page.tsx`
